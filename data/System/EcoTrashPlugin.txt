---+!! !EcoTrashPlugin

Without this plugin, %WIKITOOLNAME% is, in some environments, an ecological disaster. 
With it, %WIKITOOLNAME% is ecologically correct. (If only it had been a !SuperFund site...I'd be rich.)

%TOC%

---++ Background
%WIKITOOLNAME% deletes files and attachments by moving them to the %TRASHWEB% web. %WIKITOOLNAME% does not provide
a mechanism to expunge deleted files from the %TRASHWEB% web.

This works well for environments where infinite history is desired.

However, this is a problem in several environments:
   * Where policy requires history to be limited
   * Where for users are concerned that a  mistakenly-attached file (perhaps \
with embarrassing content) may be retained forever
   * Where disk space isn't an infinite resource

Traditionally, %WIKITOOLNAME% specifies that management of the %TRASHWEB% web requires 
command line or FTP access. This is not always possible and is error-prone.  The past advice 
was to delete and rebuild the entire %TRASHWEB% web, but various policy condsideration led to 
manual methods that left the %TRASHWEB% in inconsistent states.

---++ Features
!EcoTrashPlugin provides a means to manage the %TRASHWEB% web.  It allows you to expunge 
(permanently delete) topics and attachments from the%TRASHWEB% web.

%ICON{warning}% expunging items is irreversible (at least, without recourse to system 
backup tapes).  Please be sure that this is what you want to do.

The [[%TRASHWEB%.WebTrashManager][TrashManager]] topic, distributed with this plugin, provides a 
graphical interface to the %TRASHWEB% web's contents.  

The =tools/ecotrashsweeper= script provides a periodic maintenance function for the %TRASHWEB% web, 
which can also be invoked from the graphical interface.

Note that date/time values are provided as time serial (integer) values or as a date string formatted according to the system-wide ={DefaultDateFormat}=
and ={DisplayTimeValues}= configuration parameters.  To obtain the time, use !%CALC%'s $FORMATTIME on the integer.
---++!! !TrashManager GUI
The GUI topic does some handstands to minimize the chance of it being treated as an editable topic.  
If you're a maintainer, and you really know what you're doing, click the trashcan icon to access the usual topic editing tools.
%ENDTWISTY%
---++ !EcoTrashSweeper
The =tools/ecotrashsweeper= script performs automatic maintenance of the %TRASHWEB% web.  It should be run by =cron= 
under the webserver user.

The script:
   * Locates any =pub/%TRASHWEB%= directories that don't correspond to a %TRASHWEB% topic. (This can occur \
due to previous manual management or system failure.)  Empty directories are expunged.  Otherwise, the \
corresponding topic is created and the files found in =pub/%TRASHWEB% are attached to it.
   * Removes any metadata for attachments that were deleted without updating it. 
   * Expunges any deleted attachments or topics that are older than ={Plugins}{EcoTrashPlugin}{MaximumAge}= days.  \
This is measured from the deletion time of the item, or if none is recorded, from the last change time of the file. \
This function can be disabled by setting ={Plugins}{EcoTrashPlugin}{MaximumAge}= to zero (the default).

Switches (you *must* specify !=1 for the switch to take effect):
   * =-q=1= - When specified, the script is silent.  By default, it reports every action.
   * =-t=1= - When specified, the script runs normally, except that it does not delete anything.  This should \
be used to verify that the script is configured correctly.

Note that the script deletes directory trees directory trees under the %TRASHWEB% web.  If misconfigured, it \
can do a great deal of damage.  A trial run with -t=1 is *strongly* recommended.

The same functions are available from the graphical interface, which is a good way to do a trial run.

---++ Issues
   * Subwebs may not work properly due to the limitations of the FILEATTACHMENT metadata.
   * Only the RCS database format is supported, because the storage API doesn't provide the necessary functions.
   * The !WatchlistPlugin is not informed of the final deletion of a topic. However, since links are not usually \
updated when a topic is deleted, this doesn't seem worth doing.
   * The management page will misbehave ungracefully if the plugins listed as dependencies (below) are not satisfied.

---++ Plugin Settings

There are no user settings (%WIKITOOLNAME% preferences) for this plugin.

See the !EcoTrashPlugin parameters in the *Extensions* section of the [[%SCRIPTURL%/configure%SCRIPTSUFFIX%][configure]] \
script for the system configuration settings.

---++ Installation and Configuration

__Note:__ You do not need to install anything on the browser to use this plugin. The following instructions are for 
the administrator who installs the plugin on the %WIKITOOLNAME% server. 
%TWISTY{mode="div" showlink="Installation instructions" hidelink="Hide installation instructions" 
showimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleopen-small}%" hideimgleft="%ICONURLPATH{toggleclose-small}%"}%

__1. Plugin installation__

There are three methods available for installing this plugin.:
   * Use the [[%SCRIPTURL%/configure%SCRIPTSUFFIX%][configure]] script's extension manager.
      * Simplest, but your webserver must have write access to the %WIKITOOLNAME% code.
   * Run the installation script manually
      * Automated, works in most environments
   * Do a manual installation
      * If you don't trust automation, or have an unusual environment
%ICON{"tip"}% No matter which method you choose, if you run selinux you will probably have to correct
security context assignments for the new files and/or any intermediate directories.
%JQTABPANE%
%JQTAB{"Using Configure"}%
   * Click on this link: [[%SCRIPTURL%/configure%SCRIPTSUFFIX%][configure]]
   * Click on *Extensions*, *Find more extensions*
   * Locate <noautolink> *%TOPIC%* </noautolink>
   * Click on the link and follow the directions
%JQENDTAB%
%JQTAB{"Runing the installation script manually"}%<noautolink>
   * From your %WIKITOOLNAME% root directory:
      * Download the =%TOPIC%_installer= script and the %TOPIC%.md5 file from the Plugin Home (see below)
      * Verify that the files were downloaded correctly: =md5sum -c %TOPIC%.md5=
      * Run the installer: =perl %TOPIC%_installer= </noautolink>*
%JQENDTAB%
%JQTAB{"Manual installation"}%<noautolink>
   * Install the prerequisite plugins.  Be sure that they are at or above the minimum requred revisions.
   * Download the =%TOPIC%.zip= or =%TOPIC%.tar.gz= and =%TOPIC%.md5= files from the Plugin Home (see below)
   * Verify that the files were downloaded correctly: =md5sum -c %TOPIC%.md5=
   * Expand the file that you selected in your <noautolink>%WIKITOOLNAME%</noautolink> installation directory. Content:
   * Correct file ownership, permissions, (and selinux contexts) for your environment.
   * %ICON{"tip"}%: by default, the =tar= and =unzip= commands will set the permissions of each directory to \
those in the archive.  This can disrupt your wiki.  This can be avoided by explicitly extracting each of the files.</noautolink>*
%$MANIFEST%
%JQENDTAB%
%JQENDTABPANE%
If your [[%TRASHWEB%.WebHome][%TRASHWEB%.WebHome]] does not include the text ="WebTrashManager section="WebHomeText"= (is older than version 26956), replace it with %TRASHWEB%.WebHomeEcoTrashPlugin:
   * Rename [[%TRASHWEB%.WebHome][%TRASHWEB%.WebHome]] to <nop>%TRASHWEB%WebHome.old
   * Rename [[%TRASHWEB%.WebHomeEcoTrashPlugin][%TRASHWEB%.WebHomeEcoTrashPlugin]] to <noautolink>%TRASHWEB%.WebHome
   * You can expunge %TRASHWEB%WebHome.old</noautolink> with [[%TRASHWEB%.WebTrashManager][Trash Manager]]
Otherwise, you can expunge %TRASHWEB%.WebHomeEcoTrashPlugin.

__2. Plugin configuration and testing__

   * Run the [[%SCRIPTURL%/configure%SCRIPTSUFFIX%][configure]] script to configure the plugin.
      * Ensure that the bin/rest script is enabled and configured for authentication. (This is part of a normal %WIKITOOLNAME% installation.)
      * Check the additional settings in the *Extensions* section, and change if the defaults are not suitable for your installation.
         * ={Plugins}{EcoTrashPlugin}{AdminGroup}= - Administrator group
         * ={Plugins}{EcoTrashPlugin}{MinimumAge}= - Minimum retention period
         * ={Plugins}{EcoTrashPlugin}{MaximumAge}= - Maximum retention period
         * Check the ={Plugins}{EcoTrashPlugin}{Enabled}= box, in the =Plugins= section.
   * Optional: Configure your webserver to allow access to items in the %TRASHWEB% by your administrator(s).  \
This is normally prohibited for all users to prevent abuse, but it may be useful to an administrator who is \
reviewing %TRASHWEB% contents..
   * Visit the [[%TRASHWEB%.WebTrashManager][TrashManager]] topic and verify that the plugin is active.  %ICON{"tip"}%If you have items in \
%TRASHWEB% but the presentation looks wrong, you probably have a old version of  [[http://foswiki.org/Extensions/SpreadSheetPlugin][SpreadSheetPlugin]].  Please upgrade it.
__3.  Set up and test the maintenance function__

We recommend that you install a =crontab= entry (or equivalent) for =tools/ecotrashsweeper= to run \
under the webserver user.  This will enable automatic maintenance of the %TRASHWEB% web. 

Because the script deletes files and directories, it is important to verify that it is configured \
correctly.  We *strongly* recommend running it initially with the =-t=1= option to verify that it \
is accessing the expected directories.  This will do everything except the actual deletions.  \
(It will produce messages indicating that deletions happen - but they don't.)

You can test the script from the [[%TRASHWEB%.WebTrashManager][TrashManager]] topic by clicking *Test mode* and \
*Perform Maintenance Now*.  This will perform the exact actions that the maintenance script will \
with =-t=1=, displaying the results in your browser.  

%ICON{"tip"}% If you prefer not to set up a =cron= job, you can run the maintenance function from the \
[[%TRASHWEB%.WebTrashManager][TrashManager]] topic.  __If you elect that option, you can skip the rest of this section.__

For a manual test run from the command line (on unix), use:

<verbatim>
(cd /var/www/foswiki; nice sudo -u *apache* perl -T -I bin tools/ecotrashsweeper -t=1)
</verbatim>

Replace **apache** with the user under which the %WIKITOOLNAME% webserver runs on your system.  
It is important to use the webserver user so that updated files will have the correct permissions.

Once you are comfortable that the script is accessing the correct directories, you should 
set up a =crontab= entry for the webserver user.

A typical =crontab= entry looks like: 

<verbatim>
23 00 * * * (cd /var/www/foswiki; nice perl  -T -I bin tools/ecotrashsweeper -q=1)
</verbatim>

By default, the script will report every action.  To suppress this, use the =-q=1= switch.

For a log, use:

<verbatim>
23 00 * * * (cd /var/www/foswiki; nice perl  -T -I bin tools/ecotrashsweeper >>/var/www/foswiki/data/ecotrashsweeper.log)
</verbatim>

A somewhat simpler (equivalent) command structure on systems where perl scripts can be executed directly is:

<verbatim>
(cd /var/www/foswiki/bin; nice ../tools/ecotrashsweeper -q=1)
</verbatim>
